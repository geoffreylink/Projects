Although, the choice of 10 is arbitrary, the test has asymptotic results and can be easily modified. The HL test, as well as AUC, have very uninteresting results when calculated on the same data that was used to estimate the logistic regression model.

    "### Which is more important to you– model accuracy, or model performance?<a id=\"17\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy paradox is the paradoxical finding that accuracy is not a good metric for predictive models when classifying in predictive analytics. This is because a simple model may have a high level of accuracy but be too crude to be useful. For example, if the incidence of category A is dominant, being found in 99% of cases, then predicting that every case is category A will have an accuracy of 99%. Precision and recall are better measures in such cases. The underlying issue is that class priors need to be accounted for in error analysis. Precision and recall help, but precision too can be biased by very unbalanced class priors in the test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question tests your grasp of the nuances of machine learning model performance. Machine learning interview questions often look towards the details. There are models with higher accuracy that can perform worse in predictive power — how does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "It has everything to do with how model accuracy is only a subset of model performance, and at that, a sometimes misleading one. For example, if you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud. However, this would be useless for a predictive model — a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all. Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy is not the be-all and end-all of model performance."

    "\n",
    "Pruning is what happens in decision trees when branches that have weak predictive power are removed in order to reduce the complexity of the model and increase the predictive accuracy of a decision tree model. Pruning can happen bottom-up and top-down, with approaches such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each node. If it doesn’t decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned. While simple, this heuristic actually comes pretty close to an approach that would optimize for maximum accuracy."

    "### Why is “Naive” Bayes naive?<a id=\"7\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive Bayes is considered “Naive” because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probability is calculated as the pure product of the individual probabilities of components. This implies the absolute independence of features — a condition probably never met in real life.\n",
    "\n",

    "### What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context?<a id=\"6\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, it’s expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60% chance of actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had the flu, the test will be false 50% of the time, and the overall population only has a 5% chance of having the flu. Would you actually have a 60% chance of having the flu after having a positive test?\n",

    "\n",
    "Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there are throughout the data. Precision is also known as the positive predictive value, and it is a measure of the amount of accurate positives your model claims compared to the number of positives it actually claims. It can be easier to think of recall and precision in the context of a case where you’ve predicted that there were 10 apples and 5 oranges in a case of 10 apples. You’d have perfect recall (there are actually 10 apples, and you predicted there would be 10) but 66.7% precision because out of the 15 events you predicted, only 10 (the apples) are correct."

    "K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.\n",

For example, in order to do classification (a supervised learning task), you will need to first label the data you will use to train the model to classify data into your labeled groups.

    "\n",
    "Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm you are using. This can lead to the model underfitting your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy and for you to generalize your knowledge from the training set to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm you’re using. This leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in your training data, which can lead your model to overfit the data. You will be carrying too much noise from your training data for your model to be very useful for your test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, the variance, and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. Essentially, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you will lose bias but gain some variance — in order to get the optimally reduced amount of error, you will have to tradeoff bias and variance. You do not want either high bias or high variance in your model."
