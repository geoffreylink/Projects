## Peter Drucker
"Efficiency is doing things right. Effectiveness is doing the right things."

## Agile + Cloud + Continuous Deployment = Reduced Risk
1) Agile -> Sprint Retrospectives allow for incremental team growth based upon outcomes (no major team ramp-ups)
2) Cloud -> Resources can be incrementally grown based upon need (no major capital expenditures)
3) Continuous Deployment -> Incremental change enables practical deviations (no major project bets)
